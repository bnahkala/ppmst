# Prairie Pothole Management Support Tool (PPMST)

The Prairie Pothole Management Support Tool (PPMST) is an R Shiny App developed for use by landowners focused in the Des Moines Lobe of Iowa who are interested in evaluating prairie potholes in land that they own or rent. The tool provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the flood risk of individual prairie potholes based on parameters inherent to the pothole or the farming system in which it resides. The risk model is grounded in a regressional random forest machine learning model that was trained using a dataset of watershed modeling simulation output. These watershed models of individual prairie potholes were calibrated and modified based on daily growing season water levels in multiple potholes within Story County, Iowa. 

The PPMST can be accessed at the following link:

The PPMST provides users with a handful of functional features that may be further developed, including:

1. Dynamic inputs of morphological and management qualities based on current field conditions. 
2. An interactive web map that provides tools for identifying landscape characteristics (to be further developed). 
3. An assessment and interpretation of the current flood risk of the pothole. 
4. An opportunity to compare the effects of management scenarios on pothole flood risk, with the option to save the output to a downloadable report. 

Included in the App are the User's Manual and links to supporting publications of the modeling studies. 

The PPMST was developed by Brady Nahkala as part of his MS Thesis at Iowa State University. This project was part of a larger effort funded by the EPA to monitor, model and develop tools to support the assessment of prairie potholes.
